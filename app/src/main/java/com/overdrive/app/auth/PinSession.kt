/**
 * Process-singleton holding the in-memory unlock state for the OverDrive
 * UI. Companion to [PinManager], which owns persisted PIN material.
 *
 * Design points:
 *  - **In-memory only.** A process restart re-locks the UI. That's the
 *    correct behavior — if a daemon supervisor force-stops + relaunches
 *    the app, the user should re-authenticate before regaining UI
 *    access.
 *  - **Single source of truth.** MainActivity is the sole gate. The
 *    surveillance / deterrent / blocker / location-starter activities
 *    never call into this object.
 *  - **Idle timeout.** Tracked via [pausedRealtime]; on resume, if
 *    `now - pausedRealtime > autoLockMs`, the session is locked. Uses
 *    [SystemClock.elapsedRealtime] (monotonic) so a wall-clock change
 *    doesn't undo the lock.
 *  - **Screen off auto-lock.** Receiver registered from MainActivity
 *    locks the session the moment the panel turns off, regardless of
 *    the configured timeout. Keeps a momentarily-locked-then-immediately-
 *    unlocked window from existing.
