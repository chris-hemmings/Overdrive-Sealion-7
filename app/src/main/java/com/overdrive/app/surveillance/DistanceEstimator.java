/**
 * Distance / proximity inference for surveillance threats.
 *
 * <p><b>Why this class exists.</b> The previous geometric model
 * ({@link SurveillanceConfig#estimateDistanceForQuadrant}) computed metric
 * distance from the Y position of motion-block centroids assuming:
 *  <ul>
 *    <li>The image is a rectilinear pinhole projection (it isn't — BYD AVM
 *        cameras are fisheye, dewarped non-uniformly by the HAL)</li>
 *    <li>Y=0 of each quadrant is the optical horizon (it isn't — the
 *        horizon sits roughly mid-frame after dewarp)</li>
 *    <li>The motion-block centroid corresponds to the object's foot on
 *        the ground plane (it doesn't — it's the mean of all moving
 *        blocks, which for a walking person is the torso)</li>
 *    <li>Camera height is well-known (it isn't — values were estimates,
 *        not measured)</li>
 *  </ul>
 * The combined error stack produced "0.4–0.9 m" log lines for objects
 * actually 3–8 m away.
 *
 * <p><b>What this replaces it with.</b> Two independent estimates,
 * fused only when both are valid:
 *
 * <p><b>Technique A — class-conditional bbox-height inference (post-YOLO).</b>
 * Once YOLO has classified an object, the class implies a real-world
 * height with low variance (a person is 1.7 ± 0.15 m, a car 1.5 ± 0.2 m).
 * Combined with the bbox height in pixels and an effective focal length,
 * distance falls out of the standard pinhole equation
 * {@code d = (f_px × h_real) / h_pixels}. This is robust to the foot/torso
 * confusion that breaks the centroid-Y approach: bbox height is stable
 * across frames once the tracker locks, and varies slowly+monotonically
 * as the object approaches.
 *
 * <p><b>Technique B — discrete tier + trend (pre-YOLO).</b> Before YOLO
 * has fired (the sub-second window between motion-trigger and first
 * inference, or any time the motion pipeline fires without YOLO available),
 * we explicitly DO NOT produce a metric distance — we produce a discrete
 * tier ({@code NEAR/MID/FAR/UNKNOWN}) plus a trend
 * ({@code APPROACHING/STABLE/RECEDING}) computed from the lowest active
 * motion block's row and its time-derivative. Trigger logic operates on
 * tier+trend+dwell+class, all reliable in this window. User-facing copy
 * during pre-YOLO says "approaching from rear", not a fabricated number.
 *
 * <p><b>State machine.</b>
 * <pre>
 * pre-YOLO event:   tier+trend, metric=null, state=AWAITING_AI
 * YOLO confirms:    metric (Technique A), tier derived for cross-check
 * NCC tracker only: metric still computed from the tracked bbox height
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>This class is stateless. Callers (V2 motion path, AI worker, the
 * Actor tracker) compose it as needed.
